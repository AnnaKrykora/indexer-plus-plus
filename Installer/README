What is Indexer++ ?

Indexer++ is an open-source desktop files and folders search utility. 
It is a Windows search replacement which is faster, supports entire file system search, filters and more. 
The Core search engine is written in C++11, uses Win API and STL, which ensures high speed and saves memory. 
Indexer++ directly reads and parses the NTFS filesystem master files table.


Indexer++ use is governed by MIT License, which you can read in the LICENCE file.


You can search your files using a command-line as well (need to be run as administrator). 
"ifind" (Indexer++ find) implements a subset of the options of the Linux "find" command, so for 
Linux users it is easy to start right away. For those, who are not familiar with "find" command, 
here is options description with examples:

--> To build Indexer++ from source <--

Sources can be built as a normal Visual Studio solution, 
using Visual Studio 13 or later, .NET Framework 4.0. Suggested target platform is x86.
Do not upgrade VC++ Compiler and libraries in Visual Studio dialog box.
IndexerGUI project has a dependency on a "Hardcodet.NotifyIcon.Wpf" which can be installed 
(if it does not happened automatically) using NuGet package manager in Visual Studio.

Indexer++ uses (and hence depends)on RE2 regular expression engine:
